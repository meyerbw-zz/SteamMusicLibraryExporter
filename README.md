# Description
Utility to export soundtracks you potentially own through Steam. Will also generate the download depot command that you can paste into the steam client dev console to try to download the soundtrack.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. run `npm install`
3. rename `user-secrets.json.example` to `user-secrets.json` and fill in your credentials
4. run `npm start`

# Disclaimer
There are no tests and I don't know what the lowest version of node is that this will run on. I wrote it at 2 AM and used node v8.1.2 and npm 5.0.3.
